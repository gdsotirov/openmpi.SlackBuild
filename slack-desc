openmpi: OpenMPI (A High Performance Message Passing Library)
openmpi:
openmpi:   The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that
openmpi: is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research,
openmpi: and industry partners.  Open MPI is therefore able to combine the
openmpi: expertise, technologies, and resources from all across the High
openmpi: Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI
openmpi: library available.  Open MPI offers advantages for system and
openmpi: software vendors, application developers and computer science
openmpi: researchers.
openmpi:   Features implemented or in short-term development for Open MPI
openmpi: include:
openmpi:   * Full MPI-2 standards conformance
openmpi:   * Thread safety and concurrency
openmpi:   * Dynamic process spawning
openmpi:   * Network and process fault tolerance
openmpi:   * Support network heterogeneity
openmpi:   * Single library supports all networks
openmpi:   * Run-time instrumentation
openmpi:   * Many job schedulers supported 
openmpi:   * Many OS's supported (32 and 64 bit)
openmpi:   * Component-based design, documented APIs
openmpi: 
openmpi:   Open MPI is developed in a true open source fashion by a
openmpi: consortium of research, academic, and industry partners.
